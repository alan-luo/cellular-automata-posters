# TODO

Feature ideas and notes on potential *future work*:

* Update examples
* Add photo of printed posters once I actually get them printed
* Improve fun facts wording. Most of them could be computed without relying on Wolfram Alpha, however getting the simplified boolean form and categorizing the rules into classes might be tricky.
* Improve label rendering code by moving all magic numbers to variables and making margins, border widths, font size etc. customizable.
* Write an equivalent script for Conway's Game of Life and/or Langton's Ant.
* Consider supporting continuous 1D automata: https://bitbucket.org/antonio_rt/1d-continuous-cellular-automata

You're very welcome to send a pull request implementing one or more of the above (or file an issue if you have any other ideas for improvement)!
