% Combine eight of the original poster designs into one document for color proof
% printing. Run `originals.sh` first (from the root directory of the
% repository), then compile this file. Note that this might introduce tiny
% errors depending on which LaTeX engine you use, so you're probably best off
% proofing this document *and* one of the originally generated PDFs before
% committing to a "full" print run.
